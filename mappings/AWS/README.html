<h2>1. Amazon Inspector</h2>
<p>Amazon Inspector is an automated assessment service that evaluates the security and compliance of applications in AWS. It supports assessment packages for CVEs, CIS Benchmarks (various Windows and Linux platforms), Best Practices (Linux only), and Network Reachability. The result of running an assessment is a list of findings that can be used to inform decision-making processes that improve the security of applications.  </p>

</ul>
<h3>Mapping Comments</h3>
<p>The CIS Benchmarks assessment package is considered out of scope because a separate project will be responsible for mapping CIS Benchmarks and ATT&amp;CK.  </p>

Amazon Inspector does not directly protect against system modifications rather it just checks to see if security controls are in place which can inform decisions around hardening the system. Furthermore, Amazon Inspector only supports a subset of the sub-techniques for this technique.

<td align="left">The Amazon Inspector Best Practices assessment package can detect a security control setting related to remote service access on Linux endpoints. Specifically, "Disable root login over SSH". This information can be used identify insecure configurations and harden the endpoints. Amazon Inspector does not directly protect against adversaries accessing remote services. Given Amazon Inspector can only assess this security control on Linux platforms (although it also supports Windows), it only restricts access to remote services for one user account, and only supports one sub-technique [Q = (1) Do we assume an everything is locked down approach in which case it's worth pointing out it only covers one user? Or, do we assume the service is needed in which case the fact it only protects for one user (albeit important) is less important? (2) Or, is this a case where you exclude it from the mapping because it's not a practical way to mitigate the technique such as a firewall that blocks a port?], the coverage score is Minimal leading to an overall Minimal score.</td>

This information can be used to patch, isolate, and remove vulnerable software and endpoints. Amazon Inspector does not directly protect against exploitation and it is not effective against zero-day attacks, vulnerabilities with no available patch, and software that may not be analyzed by the scanner.
